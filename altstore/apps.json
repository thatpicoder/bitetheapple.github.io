In doing so, the codebase has been retooled and refactored, APIs have been restored, and compilation errors have been resolved. In the same vein, all (or maybe most?) bugs related to changes in iOS/Swift/SwiftUI over the past few years have been resolved. My goal is to put a new foundation in place to begin building on top of again. In other words, 2.0 returns OldOS to how it once was (and improves it perhaps too).",
